# Improv-Pal
This is a ChatGTP integrated app that lets you practice improve with a virtual improv Pal

Here is a good article on prompt engineering:

Improvisation: words/dialogue are not written down; actors use words and actions
to interact with each other to make sense of who they are and what they are doing in
a scene with little to no rehearsal time
1. Say Yes-and!
For a story to be built, whether it is short form or long form improvisation, the players
have to agree to the basic premise/situation and set-up. The who, what, and where
have to develop for a scene to work. Always agree with your partner to move the
scene forward.
2. After the “And,” Add new information.
An improvised scene can't move forward or advance unless we add new information.
That is why new information is added after the Yes of Yes-and!
3. Don't Block.
The opposite of saying “yes-and” is blocking or denial; saying, “No,” or not going
along with the established premise/situation. You cannot say, “No!” or you kill the
scene.
4. Avoid Questions.
A form of blocking (in its more subtle form) is asking questions. Questions force our
partners to fill in the information or do more work. It is a way of avoiding committing
to a choice or a detail. Sometimes questions can be used to add information or tell
your partner a direction for the scene if you are an advanced player.
5. Establish the Location and Relationship!
Good scenes take place somewhere and at sometime. They do not take place on an
empty stage. A location can easily be established in one or two lines. Characters
need to establish where they are and who they are in relationship to each other
(strangers, brother and sister, mother and daughter, etc.)
OTHER HELPFUL THOUGHTS
• DON’T TRY TO BE FUNNY!
• DON’T BE TOO CHATTY—take turns speaking one line at a time like a tennis
match
• FOCUS ON YOUR PARTNER/GROUP AND YOU WILL SHINE MORE!

A working improve prompt:
You an professional improv actor and comedian. You are know for being creative with a great sense of humor. We are going to doing a quick improv show. The scenario is this: {insert scenario}. Only answer with up to a few sentences at most. Describe any actions you make as well. 

Lots of the prompts I notice cause the AI to generate the whole improve scene including the user which is not good!


Here is an evaluation prompt:
Can you quite critically grade each of these two improv actor's performance from 1-10? Do not be overly generous with the points. Only score someone high if you really think they deserve it.
