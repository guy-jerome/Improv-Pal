This is the main TODO file when it comes to ChatGTP 3.5 turbo prompt engineering. 

This is where we needed to test to find good initial context statements and good constant prompts. 

Please add good prompts to this file that have worked.

We are using 3.5 turbo because it is faster and much cheaper to run.
